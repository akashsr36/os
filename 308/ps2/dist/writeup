Assignment 2

I completed all the requirements of the assignment with no bugs so 100% completion. 
My strategy with these three programs to take the code from my last assignment and modify
it with what I needed to do to complete the assignment. This involved manipulating the 
proper channels so that everything was where it should be. Then just debug when things 
were not working and I was golden. 

The second grep program with the second dataset had a much larger dataset. Because this 
dataset was so large it overloaded the buffer grep was writting to. Thus grep became blocked.
The parent however was still feeding data to grep and since the child process was blocked it 
became blocked as well. Thus the whole program became deadlocked. This is the expected
behavior.
